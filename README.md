# YouTube Thumbnail Stealer - Made By Exploits

Overview:

The YouTube Thumbnail Grabber is a Python-based tool designed to download thumbnails from any YouTube video. By simply providing a video URL, it fetches the highest available resolution thumbnail, automatically falling back to lower resolutions if needed. This tool is useful for content creators, video editors, or anyone who wants to quickly download YouTube thumbnails for personal use.

Features:

- High-Resolution Thumbnails: Downloads thumbnails in the best available quality (maxresdefault, sddefault, hqdefault, mqdefault, default).

- Supports All YouTube Links: Works with standard videos (watch?v=), shortened links (youtu.be/), and Shorts (/shorts/).

- Automatic Fallback: If the highest resolution thumbnail is not available, it automatically tries lower resolutions.

- ASCII Banner: Displays a stylish ASCII text banner at startup using pyfiglet.

- Easy to Use: Simple text-based input and straightforward output; just enter the video URL and get the thumbnail.
